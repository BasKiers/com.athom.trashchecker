# Trashcan Reminder
Homey will remind you to put the trash out! You can do this by providing a postcode, house number and country(NL/BE).

## Supported cities
Unfortunately not all cities work with the Trashcan Reminder, if you can find your house with one of the links below your house is supported:

- [mijnAfvalWijzer](http://www.mijnafvalwijzer.nl)
- [deAfvalApp](http://www.deafvalapp.nl/calendar/kalender_start.jsp)

If you wish to contribute to the project (for example by adding support for a city) I would advise you to take a look at [this explanation](https://github.com/apstemmer/com.athom.trashchecker/blob/master/developers)
